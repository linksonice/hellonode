# Hello Node
This is a very basic Hello World application written with Node.

It includes a `Dockerfile` for building a Docker image with the application, and a `Jenkinsfile` that defines a build pipeline for it.

https://getintodevops.com is where it's from, originally. Just using this to refresh the old git knowledge atm.
